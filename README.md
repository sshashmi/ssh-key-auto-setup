# 🚀 SSH Key Setup Automation Script

This script automates the setup of SSH key-based authentication across multiple Linux distributions. It's perfect for:

- Quickly setting up new **lab machines**
- Hardening servers by **disabling password logins**
- Allowing remote login without needing to manually edit SSH configs

---

## 📦 Features

- Works on **Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Rocky, AlmaLinux**, and more
- Accepts your public key via:
  - A `.pub` file (e.g., `id_rsa.pub`)
  - Manual input (paste directly)
- Backs up your existing SSH configuration
- Automatically modifies `sshd_config` for best security
- Restarts the correct SSH service (depending on OS)
- Runs system updates in the background

## 🧠 Why Two Modes?

This script works in **two flexible ways**:

### **🅰️ Fork & Push Your Key**

> Best when you **cannot transfer files** to your server.

🅱️ Direct Clone & Pass Key
Best when you can move your key to the server.

### 🛑 Warnings
Never share your private key

Make sure key-based login works before locking down password access

You need sudo access to modify SSH and restart services

Example SSH Login
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key username@your_public_ip
```
